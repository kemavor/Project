# 🔧 ECHO Output Formatting Fix

## ✅ **Problem Solved: Clean Output Like Google Gemini**

ECHO's responses were cluttered with multiple "— ECHO" signatures, making them look unprofessional compared to Google Gemini's clean output. This has been fixed.

## 🔍 **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### **❌ Problems Found:**

1. **System prompt** instructed ECHO to "Sign off as '— ECHO' to reinforce the brand"
2. **Response processing** added "— ECHO" to successful responses
3. **Error handling** added "— ECHO" to error messages
4. **Frontend display** showed additional "— ECHO" signature

### **✅ Solutions Applied:**

#### **1. Updated System Prompt**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# REMOVED:
- Sign off as "— ECHO" to reinforce the brand

# ADDED:
- Do NOT add any signatures or "— ECHO" text to your responses
- Provide clean, professional responses like Google Gemini
- Clean and concise communication style
```

#### **2. Fixed Response Processing**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# BEFORE:
"response": response.text + "\n\n— ECHO"

# AFTER:
"response": response.text
```

#### **3. Fixed Error Handling**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# BEFORE:
"response": f"Error message...\n\n— ECHO"

# AFTER:
"response": f"Error message..."
```

#### **4. Removed Frontend Signature Display**

**File:** `src/components/ChatbotInterface.tsx`

```tsx
// REMOVED:
{
  message.role === "assistant" && (
    <span className="text-xs font-medium text-blue-600">— ECHO</span>
  );
}
```
