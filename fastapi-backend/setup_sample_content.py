# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Learning from labeled data
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Learning from unlabeled data
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- Algorithms: K-means, Principal Component Analysis

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learning through interaction with environment
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient

## Key Concepts

### Features and Labels
- Features: Input variables (X)
- Labels: Output variables (y)
- Training data: {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)}

### Model Training Process
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Selection
5. Training
6. Evaluation
7. Deployment

## Applications

Machine Learning is used in:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, Drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, Risk assessment
- Marketing: Customer segmentation, Recommendation systems
- Transportation: Self-driving cars, Route optimization

Python for Data Science - Basics

## Python Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types
```python
# Numbers
x = 10          # integer
y = 3.14        # float
z = 2 + 3j      # complex

# Strings
name = "Data Science"
message = 'Hello, World!'

# Lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

# Dictionaries
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

### Control Structures
```python
# If statements
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x equals 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```

### Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
