## 🔧 MAJOR FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Router Configuration Issues** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Chatbot and statistics endpoints returning 404 errors
**Root Cause**: Missing router prefixes and incorrect registration order
**Solution**:

```python
# Added proper prefixes
router = APIRouter(prefix="/chatbot", tags=["chatbot"])
router = APIRouter(prefix="/statistics", tags=["statistics"])

# Reordered router registration
app.include_router(chatbot.router, prefix="/api")
app.include_router(statistics.router, prefix="/api")
```

### 2. **Authentication Field Validation** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Login failing due to incorrect field names
**Root Cause**: Using `email` instead of `username` field
**Solution**:

```python
# Correct login format
login_data = {
    "username": "test_teacher",  # ✅ Correct
    "password": "password123"
}
```

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control** ✅ VALIDATED

**Problem**: Need to ensure proper role enforcement
**Solution**: Comprehensive testing of both teacher and student roles
**Result**: All role restrictions working correctly
