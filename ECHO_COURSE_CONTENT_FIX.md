# 🔧 ECHO Course Content Access Fix

## ✅ **Problem Identified and Fixed**

ECHO was showing "Course content used" badge but saying it doesn't have access to course information for CENG 415. This was due to AWS S3 access issues in the local development environment.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **❌ Issues Found:**

1. **AWS Credentials**: Local development environment has `USE_IAM_ROLE=true` but no IAM role configured
2. **S3 Access**: ECHO couldn't access S3 bucket to retrieve course content
3. **Incorrect Badge Logic**: "Course content used" was showing even when no content was actually accessed
4. **Poor Error Handling**: No clear explanation of why course content wasn't available

### **✅ Solutions Applied:**

#### **1. Fixed S3 Client Configuration**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# BEFORE:
self.s3_client = boto3.client(
    's3',
    region_name=os.getenv('AWS_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
    aws_access_key_id=os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    aws_secret_access_key=os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
)

# AFTER:
use_iam_role = os.getenv('USE_IAM_ROLE', 'false').lower() == 'true'

if use_iam_role:
    # Use IAM role (no credentials needed)
    self.s3_client = boto3.client(
        's3',
        region_name=os.getenv('AWS_REGION', 'us-east-1')
    )
else:
    # Use access keys
    self.s3_client = boto3.client(
        's3',
        region_name=os.getenv('AWS_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
        aws_access_key_id=os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
        aws_secret_access_key=os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    )
```

#### **2. Fixed Course Content Detection Logic**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# BEFORE:
course_content_used = course_id is not None and self.course_content_enabled

# AFTER:
course_content_available = course_id is not None and self.course_content_enabled
course_content_files = self.get_s3_course_content(course_id) if course_id and self.course_content_enabled else []
course_content_used = len(course_content_files) > 0
```

#### **3. Improved Error Handling**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# BEFORE:
return "No course content available for this course."

# AFTER:
return f"No course content found for Course ID: {course_id}. This course may not have any uploaded materials yet, or the content may be stored in a different location. In a local development environment, course content from S3 may not be available."
```

#### **4. Enhanced System Prompt**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# ADDED:
**When No Course Content is Available:**
- Clearly state that no course materials are currently available
- Explain that this may be due to local development environment limitations
- Ask the student to provide more details about the course
- Suggest checking with the instructor for course materials
- Offer to help with general educational questions
- Provide guidance on how to access course content
- Mention that course content will be available in production environment
```

#### **5. Added Course Information Integration**

**File:** `fastapi-backend/routers/chatbot.py` and `fastapi-backend/services/gemini_service.py`

```python
# Enhanced course context with database information:
if course_info:
    course_info_text = f"""
Course Information:
- Title: {course_info.get('title', 'Unknown')}
- Description: {course_info.get('description', 'No description available')}
- Credits: {course_info.get('credits', 'Unknown')}
"""
    course_context = course_info_text + "\n" + course_context
```

## 🎯 **Result: Better User Experience**

### **✅ Before (Confusing):**

```
User: "what is this course about?"
ECHO: "I do not have access to any information about the course you are referring to..."
[Course content used badge showing]
```

### **✅ After (Clear and Helpful):**

```
User: "what is this course about?"
ECHO: "I can see you're asking about CENG 415. While I don't currently have access to the course materials (this may be due to local development environment limitations), I can help you with general questions about this course. Could you provide more details about what specific aspects of CENG 415 you'd like to know about?"
[No course content used badge - accurate]
```
