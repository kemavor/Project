## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Teacher selects architecture** → `StreamingArchitectureSelector`
2. **Architecture stored** → `useStreamingArchitecture` hook
3. **Configuration generated** → Architecture-specific settings
4. **Stream creation** → Properly formatted data sent to backend
5. **Setup instructions** → `StreamingSetupGuide` component

### Key Components

#### 1. Architecture Selection
```typescript
const { architecture, setArchitecture, getArchitectureInfo } = useStreamingArchitecture('mediasoup');
```

#### 2. Data Formatting
```typescript
const streamData = {
  title: formData.title,
  course_id: parseInt(formData.course_id),
  max_viewers: parseInt(formData.max_viewers.toString()),
  is_public: formData.is_public,
  is_recording: formData.is_recording,
  quality_settings: {
    resolution: formData.quality_settings.resolution,
    frameRate: parseInt(formData.quality_settings.frameRate.toString()),
    bitrate: parseInt(formData.quality_settings.bitrate.toString()),
    architecture: architecture
  }
};
```

#### 3. Validation
```typescript
// Validate course_id is a valid number
const courseId = parseInt(formData.course_id);
if (isNaN(courseId)) {
  toast.error('Please select a valid course');
  return;
}

// Validate that the course exists and belongs to the teacher
const selectedCourse = courses.find(course => course.id === courseId);
if (!selectedCourse) {
  toast.error('Selected course not found. Please refresh and try again.');
  return;
}
```
